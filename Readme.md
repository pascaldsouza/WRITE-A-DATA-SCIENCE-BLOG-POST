## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1.Iam from india As a programmer, should I go to work in the Europe  or work in asia including india?

2.What is the salary difference in the Europe and in the Asia?

3.How are the programmers satisfying about their job between these two sides of the world?

4.Are there more jobs opportunity in the Europe than that in the Asia?

## File Descriptions


The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available below.
